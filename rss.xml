<p>At the moment the experiment is 4 months old :) and continues, with pure effort spent on this project I'd say at least 3 months and 1 week.</p><p>There were complications involving me needing to touch other services within the company codebase, owned by other teams, some of them critical like payments, which took a good piece of overall timeline, but the core is a single service with front pages, auth hidden pages, admin, some internal APIs, workers and cron jobs.</p>
<p>So pretty much typical project.</p><p>At some point in time I started to doubt whether I output results at the full possible speed.</p>
<p>A lot of people saying that they did with AI something x10 faster than it would be done without before, so reasonably this project shouldn't take 40 developer/months without using AI agents. I changed approaches and AI tools during this experiment, and at the moment I have a setup where I'm fully dedicated to review of that gigantic AI output and I cannot find where I can find x2..3...4...etc speedup.</p><p>And while measuring of the development speed is something that's not solved well in the industry at the moment I still want to try to compare a process before heavily relying on AI agents and current approaches in terms of how much time it saves.</p>
<p>Typical approaches taken in the organization to measure velocity wouldn't work here as I do not have story points, estimations in hours, team, etc.. So I'll try to measure a one task purely relying on my understanding of my process of development with AI agents and without.</p>]]></description><link>https://learning-architect.blog/speed-of-ai-agents/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://learning-architect.blog/speed-of-ai-agents/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eugene]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Utilizing LLMs To Accomplish Dev Tasks On Example]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I got tasked with integrating another internal API into an LLM-based agent that I was working on. The application already had several APIs connected, but this new addition was crucial, and I was looking for a way to automate the integration process. The challenge wasn’t just about hooking up the API—it was about transforming the complex internal structures into something more digestible for the LLM. Basically, the API needed a makeover: stripping out internal entities, identifiers, and making the data coherent and contextually relevant for the AI.</p><p>Now, generally speaking, adding a new API is a pretty clear-cut process—parse the endpoints, connect the dots, and fit it into the application. But it's also a time-consuming routine. It’s not just about writing the code but ensuring everything aligns perfectly, which eats up a lot of time, especially when scaling this up to integrate more APIs quickly. We wanted to simplify this routine, making it more efficient and repeatable.</p><p>I’ve been using GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT extensively in my coding routine, and they’ve been great. But for this task, I wanted to see if there was a better, more streamlined way. That’s when I decided to experiment with Cursor Editor and a custom script approach, hoping they could give me that extra edge.</p>]]></description><link>https://learning-architect.blog/utilizing-LLMs-to-accomplish-dev-tasks-on-example/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://learning-architect.blog/utilizing-LLMs-to-accomplish-dev-tasks-on-example/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eugene]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Create Custom Gpts]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>If you missed OpenAI's Dev Days presentation, you missed out on Sam Altman, the CEO, <del>killed many startups</del> has shown updates to OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Haven't seen it? Do yourself a favor and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk" target="_blank">watch it here</a>. It's not just a presentation; it's a glimpse into the future, at least until the next big thing rolls around.</p>

<p>Post-presentation, like many others, I had a lightbulb moment. Why not feed all our internal organization docs to a GPT and let it do the heavy lifting? Then just kick back, relax, and sip coconuts on an island somewhere.</p>

<p>Turns out, it's not as easy as Sam made it look. If your company's processes and org structure resemble a labyrinth, you'll need to roll up your sleeves. It's not all AI magic and coconut sipping, unfortunately. But at the same time, it is much-much-much-.....-much easier than it was before. We just need a little bit of wizarding around crafting precise instructions to GPT.</p>

<p>As of writing this, internet does not have a lot of takes on how to make it work. So, I decided to put my two cents in and draft one.</p>]]></description><link>https://learning-architect.blog/create-custom-gpts/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://learning-architect.blog/create-custom-gpts/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eugene]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mobx Async Data]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Asynchronous data loading is a pervasive challenge in modern web development.</p>

<p>The team agreed on the goals and the points that need to be achieved. Now we finally need to move on to the solution and discuss one or another idea.</p>

<p>Suppose we have several solutions and all of them already meet the requirements. Solutions that do not meet the requirements are not considered by default.</p>
<p>More precisely, if we imagine collective work - then we gently remind that some requirement is not considered in the solution and it needs to be either expanded or not considered.</p>]]></description><link>https://learning-architect.blog/architect-team-discussions-part-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://learning-architect.blog/architect-team-discussions-part-2/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eugene]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tests Is Speed]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I constantly hear that in order to write tests, you need to increase the time estimate for the task by 1.2, 1.5, 2, 3 times.</p>

Usually, there is a person in the team who has the final say, for example, the tech lead. But sometimes there are disagreements that are quite difficult because the team consists of senior people, each of whom has many arguments why their opinion should be heard.</p>

<p>If there is only one architect on the project, then this problem is less pronounced in their work because there is an option, in case of equivalent solutions, to keep the last word to themselves. Not always their option, but it is important that there is an opportunity to stop the argument if it exists.</p>

<p>However, if there is a team of architects on the project, then an interesting game begins here. Even if there is a lead or a CTO among them, the decision is still an exhausting activity. Everyone understands that architects are specialists who know their job, and it is necessary to try to listen to everyone, but since everyone has a bunch of arguments for their options and in opposition to the opponent, a lot of energy is spent.</p>

<p>Once, I was in such a situation for a very long time and at one point, I got tired of it and started thinking about how to get out of it.</p>]]></description><link>https://learning-architect.blog/architect-team-discussions-part-1/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://learning-architect.blog/architect-team-discussions-part-1/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Eugene]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
