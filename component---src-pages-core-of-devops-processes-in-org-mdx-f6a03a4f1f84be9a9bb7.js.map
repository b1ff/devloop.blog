New developers arrived, the business wanted more, and increasing the number of admins and approaching the configuration of each server with a touch of romance when servers for the same thing were configured slightly differently was not a radical response to such growth.\\nAnd then they immediately learned how to use Puppet and Chef to distribute identical infrastructure, then added more dynamics and stuffed all applications under orchestrators, in which a whole world for applications is built-in out of the box.\\nBut again, \", React.createElement(_components.strong, null, \"all this was a response to specific problems, often in the context of specific organizations\"), \".
